I have been doing a lot of daydreaming lately. Moving to a new city and living
alone at the height of a pandemic has given me a lot of free time, so I guess
it can't be helped. One of the few things I can't get off mind lately is
the *vaporwave* meme. I have been listening to vaporwave unironically nonstop
and can't seem to stop.

*"What is vaporwave?"* you might ask. From wikipedia [^1]

> Vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music, a visual art style, and an
Internet meme that emerged in the early 2010s. It is defined by its mimetic
embrace of Internet culture and its sampling of 1980s and 1990s styles such
as smooth jazz, elevator music, R&B, and lounge music, typically manipulating
tracks via chopped and screwed techniques and other effects.

Common features of the vaporwave visual ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ are described below.

> The visual aesthetic (often stylized as "ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ", with fullwidth
characters) incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch
art, and cyberpunk tropes, as well as anime, Greco-Roman statues, and
3D-rendered objects.

Part of what drew me back to this meme was the heavy use of nostalgia...



A curious trait of the aesthetic is its common use of stylized Japanese text.
Why does vaporwave incorporate so much Japanese imagery? Memes? Maybe. However,
there is a much better explanation, that has to do with the post WWII history
of Japan.

Japan was left devastated after WWII and its prospects were bleak to say the
least.  Marshall Plan  

Japan in the 80s was the culmination

bubble came crashing down in the early 90s causing the lost decade
