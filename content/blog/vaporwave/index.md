I have been doing a lot of daydreaming lately. Moving to a new city and living
alone at the height of a pandemic has given me a lot of free time, so I guess
it can't be helped. One of the few things I can't get off mind lately is
the *vaporwave* meme. I have been listening to vaporwave unironically and
can't seem to stop.

*"What is vaporwave?"* you might ask. From wikipedia [^1]

> Vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music, a visual art style, and an
Internet meme that emerged in the early 2010s. It is defined by its mimetic
embrace of Internet culture and its sampling of 1980s and 1990s styles such
as smooth jazz, elevator music, R&B, and lounge music, typically manipulating
tracks via chopped and screwed techniques and other effects.

Common features of the vaporwave visual ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ are described below.

> The visual aesthetic (often stylized as "ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ", with fullwidth
characters) incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch
art, and cyberpunk tropes, as well as anime, Greco-Roman statues, and
3D-rendered objects.

Part of what drew me back to this meme was the heavy use of nostalgia...

A curious trait of the aesthetic is its common use of stylized Japanese
text [^2] [^3]. Why does vaporwave incorporate so much Japanese imagery? Memes?
Maybe. Beyond memes, there is a much deeper explanation that has to do with
the post WWII history of Japan.

Japan was left devastated after WWII and its prospects were bleak to say the
least. The Marshall Plan, coupled with a strong U.S. presence, helped Japan
get back on its feet economically and kickstarted an unrivaled period of
economic growth.

Japan in the 80s was the culmination of this period of economic growth and
saw the expansion of now familiar companies such as Sony, Panasonic, Nintendo,
Casio, and Toyota. At the time, Japan's economy was second only to the United
States by GDP [^4], and there were fears in the U.S. that Japan would surpass the
U.S. to become the worlds dominant superpower [^5]. The following video explains
1980s Japan as it appears as the setting of Netflix's *Earthquake Bird*.

This era of history post war up until the early 1990s is now referred to as
the Japanese economic miracle. It came to a sharp halt in 1991 when Japan's
asset price bubble collapsed, and the period that followed became known
as the lost decade [^6].

As a bonus, here is a vaporwave inspired 3D animation. This is my first
project using [three.js](https://threejs.org/), JavaScript library that
uses WebGL, a JavaScript API that leverages your computer's GPU to render
graphics in the browser.
