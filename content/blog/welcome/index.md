Hello and welcome to my new website! Regrettably, this website has been in an
unfinished state for quite some time now, but thanks to social distancing
I finally have had the time and motivation to work it seriously. I’ve been
working hard on multiple projects recently and hope to showcase them on
this website / blog.

To get started, I want to highlight a project I’ve been
working on — [Linguistic Phylogenies](/posts/linguistic-phylogenies).
Also, I recently returned from trip that included
Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. Head over to [Travelogue](/travelogue) view my photos
and keep up to date on where I've been.

I plan to add some cool projects to the site soon, so stay tuned!

Here's a little bit about this site — I built it
using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Gatsby is super cool static site
generator built on top of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). It's been a pleasure to use so far, and I
highly recommend checking it out! You can view the source code for this website
on [GitHub](https://github.com/csshen/cshen-site#readme) if you're interested.
