Hello and welcome to my new website! Regrettably, this website has been in an
unfinished state for quite some time now, but thanks to social distancing
measures I finally have the time and motivation to work on it and have
made enough progress that I am happy with publishing the site. I’ve been
working hard on multiple projects recently and hope to showcase them on
this website / blog.

To get started, I want to highlight two recent projects I’ve been
working on — [Linguistic Phylogenies](/posts/linguistic-phylogenies) and
[Arcadia](/posts/arcadia). Also, I recently returned from trip that included
Japan, Taiwan, and Korea and took a lot of pictures!  Head over to
[Travelogue](/travelogue) to see photos and maps.

I am hoping to add something new to the site every one to two weeks,
so stay tuned!

If you're still reading this, here's a little bit about this site — I built it
using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Gatsby is super cool static site
generator built on top of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and GraphQL.
It's been a pleasure to use so far, and I highly recommend checking it out.
