Hello and welcome to my brand new website! I've been meaning to refresh
my website for quite some time, and now I finally can say I have.

Stuff I Used to Make This Site

* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a really cool static site generator
built with React.
* [gatsby-starter-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/)
is starter written by [Kyle Matthews](https://twitter.com/kylemathews) that
has boilerplate for blogging, analytics, and much more.
* [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) is an awesome React component library
and design framework.
* [Netlify](https://netlify.com) is a fantastic service for deploying websites.
* [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) is a great platform for buying domain names.
