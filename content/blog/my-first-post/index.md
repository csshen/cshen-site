Hello and welcome to my new website! I've been meaning to refresh my site
for quite some time so I'm .

Stuff I Used to Make This Site

* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a really cool static site generator
built with React.
* [gatsby-starter-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/)
was written by [Kyle Matthews](https://twitter.com/kylemathews) and
contains boilerplate for blogging, analytics, and much more for Gatsby.
* [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) is an awesome React component library
and design framework.
* [coolors](https://coolors.co/) is a great tool for quickly generating color schemes.
* [Netlify](https://netlify.com) is a fantastic service for hosting and
 deploying websites.
